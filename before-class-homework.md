# Pre-class assignment
The world of git and GitHub comprises much material, so we all need to have our computers ready before class.  You will be installing two programs: git and gitHub-desktop, which have an overlapping purpose but vastly different user-experience philosophies.  I am exposing you to both because one is a good gateway and the other is how things are done by the pros.  When I began using git, I used both for a while, but today I exclusively use git.  

Just a bit of nomenclature to start.  
**Git** is a *command-line program* that runs on your computer that you will use to manage changes to your documents.  
**GitHub** is a *web service company* and also the web service that company provides (think Google).  
**GitHub-Desktop** is a graphical program that GitHub (the company) provides to make Git (the command-line program) more accessible to learn.  

## Sign up on GitHub
If you have not created an account on github.com (the site you are visiting right now) then click "Sign up" in the upper right.

## Install GitHub Desktop
Unless you installed this before, you won't have this on your system.  
- Navigate to https://desktop.github.com
- Download and install for your operating system

**Note** This will install both git and GitHub Desktop.  You could have installed git first, but by leading with GitHub Desktop install, several options are selected in a sensible manner for us.  

## Prepare your workspace directory
You will need to pick a folder for your repositories.  A repository is just a folder on your computer that git monitors.  I recommend creating a new folder to keeping all your repositories together.  Personally, I use D:/repos/ (on Windows) /home/repos/ on Linux because I prefer a short path and I like seeing all my repositories in one place.  You may alternatively scatter your repositories out into topic-related folders, for example one repository in a BALP folder, another in the folder where you're writing a novel, but there is one hard requirement: **a repository must not be in a cloud-synced folder.** That means it can not be inside a google drive or a dropbox folder. 

## Video Introduction
Watch the first video [here](https://git-scm.com/videos).   And write down any questions.  Feel free to watch the other 3 videos too, but the first video is the essential one.
